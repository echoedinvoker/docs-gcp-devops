There are two main roles in the software development lifecycle: Developers and Operators.

| DEVELOPERS | OPERATORS |
|------------|-----------|
| Developer write code | Operator know how to deploy & monitor application |
| Update software | Operators don't know how to write code |
| Adding new feature | They know how to assemble code |
| Don't bother about stability | Solve Production issue |
| They want to push code faster to Prod | How to scale Application |
| | They love less updates |

From the table above, it can be seen that developers only want to quickly add features, while operators only want to run applications stably. The goals of the two are conflicting. From this conflict, *DevOps* was born.
